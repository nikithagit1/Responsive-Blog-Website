‘So unfair’
“Ananya, you haven’t even touched your tiffin. Everything ok?” Nyasa asked. “Nyasa, I am super bummed. Just feel so upset that I can’t even begin to tell you! I asked mom to give me permission for a sleepover at Neha’s home this weekend, she did not allow me!” Ananya complained. “But my brothergets to go to his friend’s place to play video games whenever he likes. He always gets his way.This is unfair!”she added.“Oh I can relate to you Ananya. Calm down. Did you ask your mom why she denied your request for  asleepover?” Nyasa  suggested. “Yes, the usual, she told me that she is worried about  my safety”,  Ananya replied . “My mom gives me the same
reason”, added Deepti, who sat next to them and was overhearing their conversation.“I know, I am so upset”, Ananya sulked. Sit at home ?“Well  we should  think  from our parent’s angle too. Their concern is very relevant , considering how unsafe the society has become. The other day a dog went missing and some days ago someone stole my cycle!”, Nyasa tried to reason. “So what should we do? Sit at  home and not venture  out?  ” a frustrated Ananya asked. “Try to reason with your mom. Maybe introduce her to Neha, so she is well acquainted with her family. This way Aunty will  feel safe about your conveyance. You can give her Neha’s  or   her mother’s  phone number so she can call if she needs to check up on you”,Nyasa suggested.“I think that would be a great idea Nyasa,maybe you should try it”, Deepti chipped in while munching on her sandwich.“Deepti, it worked for me last time I wanted to go for a sleepover at my friend Sheetal’s house. Guess what, now her mom and my mom are very good friends too.My mom drops me at her house,spends some time there and has a chit chat too with Sheetal’s mom”, Nyasa smiled.  But that is not the point! “I will use your methodDeepti. Let me see if it works at my house or not but that’s not the real point here. Don’t you guys also feel that we  as girls are treated  differentlythan our brothers or male friends?” Ananya asked. Both of them nodded.“Do our parents not love us as much as our brothers?” Ananya said, probably asking a question to herself.  “I feel you Ananya but please don’t feel thisway! Of course they love us”, Deepti said. “You know the other day I was uploading a picture on Instagram and my mother asked me to delete it, saying it was not safe for me to do so. But when my younger  brother does that ,she says he is just a kid! ” Ananya complained again. “Well, you know how these online trolls are! I have actually deactivated my Instagram account because of this. The comments on my page were so horrible.Your mom might be worried about your online safety too. And yes, I am sure when your brother is of your age, he will get to hear the same”, Nyasa replied.“But Nyasa it is not just that.You know the other day at my aunt’s place I was asked to help with all the cleaning while my brother was just chilling on the sofa”, Ananya’s complaints were not over yet! support system”, Madhu ma’am said. “But ma’am parents don’t listen to us.If we try to explain any of our points of view to them, they say we are arguing!” Nyasa, who was a silent listener till now, said. “They will listen one day, Nyasa. Mine eventually did. You just have to  be extremely patient and even  listen to them too . It takes time to change the things that have been going on for a long time. A good conversation is always two ways, right?” Madhu ma’am said and the bell rang . Everyone hurriedly finished  their  lunch and got up ! “Let us go guys or we will  be late for our  lecture”, Nyasa “Thanks Ma’am . This was a very good discussion . We should talk more about this . Perhaps we can also have a club ! ” the girls said in excitement as they rushed to their class. </p>

<p class="aligned-paragraph">
Dogs can become confused, as we have already mentioned. The most common cause of confusion is new training lessons. Dogs can become overwhelmed and flustered when learning new skills. This can lead to certain behaviors, and your dog will let you know if they are frustrated or confused.

If your dog starts barking while you’re training them, it could be a sign they are confused. This is especially true if they can’t understand what you are saying or how to respond to it. Sometimes dogs will shut down completely and not want to do what they’re doing. If your dog is feeling confused or unable to understand the situation, they may walk, sit, or lay down away from you.
Dogs who are confused may become aggressive towards you or snap at you. Other dogs may seek out more affection and be more “lovey-dovey,” as they seek comfort during this difficult and confusing time. Your dog’s actions will differ, so be aware of signs your dog is confused.1. We leave them alone
As born socialites, dogs make friends easily. Puppies are intensely interested in spending time with other dogs, people, and any species willing to interact with them socially. They usually play, rest, explore and travel with company. Yet we often leave dogs alone: at home, in kennels or the vet clinic.
In these situations, naive dogs can’t be sure we’ll ever return to collect them. Only after experience are they likely to expect a reunion, and even then, their experience depends on the context.
At home, we may try to enforce dog-free zones. Naturally, many dogs protest. How can they stay with their (human) social group when they’re separated behind impenetrable barriers (doors)? This explains why dogs so often demand to be let inside when their human family is there, and why those with separation-related distress frequently find some solace in being indoors.2. We are visually driven
Dogs live in an olfactory world, while ours is chiefly visual. So, while TVs may offer a visual feast for humans, parks and beaches are an olfactory banquet for dogs.

An additional challenge is dogs move while investigating the world, whereas we often sit still. They may not relish the inertia we enjoy in front of a noisy, flashing light-box.

3. We change our shape and smell
Shoes, coats, wallets, briefcases, bags and suitcases: countless smells cling to these items after we take them into shops and workplaces, then back to our dogs. Cleaning products, soaps, deodorants and shampoos also change the scents our dogs are used to.

Towels, hats and bags change our shape when we’re using them. And when we’re pulling them on, jumpers and coats alter our visual outline and may catch dogs unaware.

Dogs change their coats at least once a year. In contrast, we change our external cladding every day. This means the odours we carry are changing far more than dogs have evolved to expect.

In their olfactory world, it must be puzzling for dogs to encounter our constantly changing smells, especially for a species that uses scent to identify familiar individuals and intruders.

4. We like to hug
How humans use their forelimbs contrasts sharply with how dogs do. We may use them to carry large objects a dog would have to drag, but also to grasp each other and express affection.

Dogs grasp each other loosely when play-wrestling, and also when mating and fighting. Being pinned by another dog hinders a quick escape. How are puppies to know what a hug from a human means, when that behaviour from a dog might be threatening?

5. We don’t like to be bitten
Play-fighting is fun for many puppies and helps them bond with other dogs. But they must monitor the behaviour of other dogs in play-fights and know when they’ve used their tiny, razor-sharp teeth excessively.

Humans are much more susceptible to pain from playful puppy jaws than other dogs are, and so we can react negatively to their attempts to play-fight with us.

Dogs interact with objects almost entirely with their muzzle. And to feed, they use their jaws, teeth and tongue.

Dogs also “mouth” other dogs when playing, expressing affection and communicating everything from “more” to “please don’t” to “Back off!”. So, naturally, they try to use their mouths when communicating with us, and must be puzzled by how often we take offence.

6. We don’t eat food from the bin
Dogs are opportunists who naturally acquire food anywhere they find it. In contrast, we present them with food in dishes of their own.

Puppies must be puzzled by our reaction when we find them snacking from benches and tables, in lunchboxes and kitchen bins. We should not be surprised when dogs unearth food we left somewhere accessible to them.

7. We share territories
We visit the territories of other dogs, bringing back their odours, and allow unfamiliar human and canine visitors to enter our dogs’ home. Dogs have not evolved to accept such intrusions and threats to their safety and resources.

We shouldn’t be surprised when our dogs treat visitors with suspicion, or when our dogs are treated with hostility when we bring them to the homes of others.

8. We use our hands a lot
Sometimes our hands deliver food, scratches, massages and toys. Other times, they restrain dogs, trim nails, administer ointments or tablets, and groom with brushes and combs that may pull hair.

No wonder some dogs grow to fear the human hand as it moves about them. We can make it easier for dogs to accept many types of hand-related activities if we train them to cooperate with rewards.

But humans often misread their fear and may even greet it with violence which compounds the problem. Hand-shy dogs can easily become defensive and find their way into pounds and shelters, where life expectancy for nippers and biters is poor.

On the whole, dogs show a remarkable ability to adapt to the puzzles we throw at them. Their behavioural flexibility offers us lessons in resilience and how to live simply and socially. Our challenge is to understand the absence of guile and malice in everything they do.

Road accidents are one of the most relevant causes of injuries and death worldwide, and therefore, they constitute a significant field of research on the use of advanced algorithms and techniques to analyze and predict traffic accidents and determine the most relevant elements that contribute to road accidents. The research of road accident prediction aims to respond to the challenge of offer tools to generate a more secure mobility environment, and ultimately, save lives. This paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art in the prediction of road accidents through machine learning algorithms and advanced techniques for analyzing information, such as convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks, among other deep learning architectures. Furthermore, in this article, a compendium and study of the most used data sources for the road accident forecast is made. And a classification is proposed according to its origin and characteristics, such as open data, measurement technologies, onboard equipment and social media data.

For the analysis of the information, the different algorithms employed to make predictions about road accidents are listed and compared, as well as their applicability depending on the types of data being analyzed, along with the results obtained and their ease of interpretation and analysis.

The best results reported by the authors are obtained when two or more analytic techniques are combined, in such a way that analysis of the obtained results is strengthened. Among the future challenges in road traffic forecasting lies the enhancement of the scope of the proposed models and predictions by the incorporation of heterogeneous data sources, that include geo spatial data, information from traffic volume, traffic statistics, video, sound, text and sentiment from social media, that many authors concur that can improve the precision and accuracy of the analysis and predictions.

1. Introduction
Traffic accidents have become one of the leading causes of death and injuries worldwide, with more than 1.25 million of deaths per year, between 20 and 50 million injured and a global proportion of 18 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (World Health Organization, 2015). Most of these deaths occur in undeveloped countries (16%) and in developing countries (74%), which converts mortality from traffic accidents, not only into a public health problem, but also into a socio-economic development issue.

To address this public health and socio-economic problem, the United Nations proposes in the initiative The Global Goals for sustainable development (The Global Goals, 2017), in the numeral three, to reduce in a half the world number of deaths and injuries resulting from traffic accidents by 2020. Therefore, investigation on prediction and prevention of traffic accidents are highly relevant to fulfill this goal for sustainable development and to reduce the mortality on roads.

Several studies have been carried out to propose road accident prediction and analysis models, each one of them framed within the socioeconomic, cultural and development conditions of the country where it was proposed, and therefore, making evident the difficulty of proposing a single predictive or analytical model that works in all contexts. The main areas of interest that these models study are i) detection of problematic areas for circulation (Cao et al., 2015; Fawcett et al., 2017; Kumar and Toshniwal, 2016a, Kumar and Toshniwal, 2016b); ii) real time detection of traffic incidents (D'Andrea et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2016); iii) road accident forecasting (Chen et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2017; Park et al., 2016; Shi and Abdel-Aty, 2015; You et al., 2017); and iv) prediction the severity of the consequences suffered by involved in a road accident (Kaplan and Prato, 2013; Mohamed et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2019).

Current advances in analytic algorithms and machine learning methods allow researchers to propose models of complex issues in the study and prediction of road accidents, such as the mining of heterogeneous data sources (Moriya et al., 2018), the process and classification of real time data flows (Chen et al., 2018; D'Andrea et al., 2015), the need to process multi-dimensional data having strong prediction capabilities (Zheng et al., 2019), and to study, analysis and model the real-time information provided by on-road equipment such as loop inductors, cameras and radar equipment (Ozbayoglu et al., 2016; You et al., 2017). Therefore, the study of road accident prediction is a field of relevant and current scientific knowledge, open to innovation in the research of algorithms and data analysis techniques that respond to the challenge of generating a more secure mobility environment, which considers the particularities of each country or region, i.e., traffic composition, weather conditions, roads conditions, and demography.
